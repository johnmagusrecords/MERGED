# MAGUS PRIME X - Secure Distribution Guide

## The Issue With Your Current Build

The current Electron build of MAGUS PRIME X has your Capital.com credentials embedded directly in the compiled application package. This means:

1. Anyone who runs your distributed application will see your API credentials
2. They could potentially access your trading account
3. Simple file deletion cannot remove this information

## Secure Distribution Solution

### Option 1: Create a Clean Application Build (Recommended)

To create a proper distribution without credentials:

1. Create a new Windows user account on your computer (temporary)
2. Log in to this new user account
3. Copy only the source files from the `main` folder (not the compiled app)
4. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to create a fresh build
5. This new build will not have any stored credentials

### Option 2: Manual Build Without Source Code

If you don't want to rebuild:

1. Use the original Electron website template without the compiled app
2. Direct users to visit the website version
3. Include clear instructions that they need their own Capital.com API credentials

### Option 3: Third-Party Distribution Service

There are services that can package applications with credential security:

1. Consider using a service like Electron Forge or similar
2. They have built-in security features to prevent credential leakage
3. These can create proper isolated distribution builds

## Important Notice About Your Current Build

**The current MAGUS PRIME X application has your personal credentials embedded in it and should NOT be distributed in its current state.**

All the features are working perfectly:
- The Capital.com broker connection is confirmed working
- The Chart Analyzer module is fully functional with all technical indicators
- Candlestick pattern detection and chart pattern recognition are implemented

But these features will be accessing YOUR account unless a clean build is created.

## Steps for Safe Distribution

1. Start completely fresh with a new build
2. Test on a separate machine to confirm no credentials are present
3. Create detailed instructions for users to add their own credentials

Each user should have their own Capital.com account and API keys to use the application properly and securely.
