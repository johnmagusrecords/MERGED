# MAGUS PRIME X - Distribution Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Secure Distribution Without Credentials

The current built application in `C:\Users\djjoh\OneDrive\Desktop\MAGUS_PRIME_X_RELEASE\user\Magus Prime X.exe` contains your personal Capital.com login information embedded within it, which is a security risk for distribution.

## Safe Distribution Method

To distribute MAGUS PRIME X without including your personal credentials:

### Method 1: Distribute Only Application Files + Instructions

1. Create a distribution ZIP file containing:
   - The executable and support files from `\user\` folder
   - The documentation files
   - A clear notice that users must create and use their own Capital.com API credentials

2. Inform users that:
   - They must have their own Capital.com account
   - They need to generate their own API keys from Capital.com
   - The first time they run the application, they MUST enter their own credentials
   - Your credentials will not work for them as the connection is specific to each user's account

### Method 2: Create a Login Screen Mod (For Future Versions)

For future versions, modify the source code to:
- Reset all stored credentials on first launch
- Present a mandatory credential input screen on first launch
- Never save credentials in the compiled executable

## Important Security Notice

When distributing trading applications:
1. Never include personal API keys or credentials
2. Clearly inform users they need their own Capital.com account
3. Make users aware that they are responsible for securing their own API keys
4. Consider implementing a secure credential manager that stores keys locally, not in the application bundle

By following these guidelines, you can safely distribute the MAGUS PRIME X application without compromising your trading account security.
