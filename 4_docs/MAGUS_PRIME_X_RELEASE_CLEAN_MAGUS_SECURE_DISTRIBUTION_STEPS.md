# MAGUS PRIME X - Secure Distribution Steps

## The Problem
Your Capital.com credentials are embedded in the compiled Electron application and cannot be removed by simply deleting files or folders.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### Option 1: Distribution with Demo Mode

1. Create a new folder in your distribution called "MAGUS PRIME X - DEMO VERSION"
2. Include only these files from your current build:
   - All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - The startup animation
   - Chart Analyzer module documentation
   - README explaining users need their own Capital.com credentials

3. Create a clear disclaimer:
   ```
   This is a DEMO VERSION of MAGUS PRIME X.
   To access the full version with live trading:
   1. Get your own Capital.com account
   2. Generate your own API credentials
   3. Enter them when prompted on first launch
   ```

### Option 2: Full Rebuild (Most Secure)

1. On a fresh computer or virtual machine (without your credentials):
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Copy only your source code files (JS, HTML, CSS, Python)
   - Run `npm install` and `npm run build`
   - This creates a completely clean build without embedded credentials

2. Test this new build to confirm:
   - It starts with no pre-filled credentials
   - The Chart Analyzer module works with test credentials
   - Capital.com connection functions properly with new credentials

### Option 3: Web Version Distribution

If rebuilding isn't feasible, consider:
1. Creating a web-based version that doesn't store credentials
2. Hosting it with proper security measures
3. Each user connects with their own Capital.com API credentials

## What to Tell Your Users

Regardless of which option you choose, make sure users know:

1. They must create their own Capital.com accounts
2. They need to generate their own API credentials
3. The application includes the full Chart Analyzer with all technical indicators, pattern detection, and analysis features
4. Their credentials will be stored securely on their local machine

## Security Best Practices

For future versions:
1. Never store credentials in the application itself
2. Use secure credential storage like system keychains
3. Consider implementing a proper login system
4. Test distribution versions without credentials before sharing
